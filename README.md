**Compliance Manager | Transitioning to Cloud & Platform Engineering**

Regulatory compliance professional with over 5 years of experience in the gambling industry, currently serving as a Compliance Manager at the Gambling Commission. I am now pivoting my focus toward **Cloud Engineering** and **Infrastructure**, leveraging a strong foundation in regulatory frameworks (UKGC, MGA, GDPR) to build secure, compliant technical systems.

## Technical Transformation
My recent technical journey has utilized **AI-assisted development** as a practical accelerator to understand software architecture and application lifecycles. While I have built full-stack applications to learn the fundamentals, my professional objective is to manage the **infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and cloud environments** that host them.

### Key Projects
**Scarlet Helix (Cloud Deployment & DNS)**
*   Deployed a React-based risk assessment tool to the edge using **Cloudflare Pages**.
*   **Engineering Focus**: Solved complex DNS challenges for free-tier dynamic domains (`dpdns.org`) using CNAME configurations and edge routing.
*   **Result**: High-availability deployment with verified SSL, bypassing standard platform limitations.

**Home Lab Infrastructure (The "ProDesk" Build)**
*   Architected a self-hosted virtualization stack on an HP ProDesk 600 G3.
*   **Tech Stack**: Proxmox VE, Ubuntu Server, Docker, Portainer, Tailscale.
*   **Engineering Focus**: Container orchestration, network security via mesh VPNs, and implementing data sovereignty.

**Compliance Automation Frameworks**
*   **Method**: Leveraged AI coding agents (Claude, Antigravity) to write Python scripts and React frontends.
*   **Outcome**: Gained deep insight into code structure and API integration while focusing my personal effort on the *deployment* and *operational* aspects of the solutions.
