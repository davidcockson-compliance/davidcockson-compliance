I like figuring out how things work—and more importantly, why they don't. 

With over 8 years in international regulatory compliance (Gambling, Marketing, GDPR), I've spent my career navigating complex rules. Now, I'm spending my time under the hood: exploring new and broken things in the cloud and building tools that turn "policy-on-paper" into resilient, automated code.
